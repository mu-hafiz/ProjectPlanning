## Idea

The main idea is to take my existing bedroom controller and convert it so that it has an OLED display that can be used as a display menu. The menu system will be navigated using a potentiometer/rotary encoder, and will have buttons to confirm and go back from the menus

## Menu System

The exact things to be used in the menu aren't set in stone yet, but some ideas are:
- Toggling the brightness/colour of the main light
- Set time for how long heater is on for & display time left
- LED Presets?

I can always think of more later, get it up and running first.

## Parts

See [[Parts List]]

I want to first test the display menu system using the LCD that I already have, and then once that works, I can buy the OLED display and get it to work with that.

## After Functionality

I then need to 3D Print a new enclosure for everything and design how it will all fit.
