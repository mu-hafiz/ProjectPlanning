## Main Idea

The main idea is to swap out the Philips and the other light on the shelves with LED strips that sync up with the other two WLED strips instead. That way, the light will actually light more things up, and will match everything better.

## Diffuser

I will need to buy an LED Diffuser for the LEDs since they will be looked at directly. I will have to cut the channels to the correct length to fit underneath the two shelves and to match the contour of the wall:

## Power

When making the Rope Light, we ran into an issue where, when the length of the wire was too long, the signal degraded, which made the strip bug out. We will need to heavily test this, as the length of the wires will have to be much longer.

---
## Sections

There will be two separate sections that act as one strip individually:
- Underneath the shelves
- Along the wall
These will then be able to act as separate strips that will have animations that go towards the middle, in essence, syncing up with each other.

This will create a cool effect as if all the lights are converging to the middle of the rope light.
